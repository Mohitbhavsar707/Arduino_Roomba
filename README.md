# Arduino_Roomba
Using Tinkercad Arduino, I created a theoretical simulation of a working Roomba (Vaccum Robot)


What it does:

The robot is designed in a way that it can navigate the entirety of a room with complete furniture. The design enables the roomba to drive forward, backwards, turn, sense objects/walls/floors, and be able to navigate away from staricases, and a change of surfaces. Additionally, manual control is provided for the user through the help of an IR Remote.
